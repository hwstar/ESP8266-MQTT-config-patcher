espcfgpatcher.py

A patching utility for ESP8266 MQTT-based nodes.

This small Python utility patches an ESP8266 code image (0x00000.bin) so that configuration parameters can be changed
post-compile. This keeps the configuation separate from the source code, and allows several variants of the same code
to be deployed in ESP8266 nodes.

The utility looks for the signature ESP8266HWSTARSR in the 0x00000.bin image file and then updates all of the default
configuration settings with those specified in a text configuration file.

USAGE is as follows:

espcfgpatcher.py patch infile.bin configfile.txt outfile.bin
espcfgpatcher.py print_config infile.bin

The utility can both patch and display the configuration values of a firmware image.

Some fields may be flagged as mandatory and will require entries in the text configuration file. This include things
like the MQTT host name, WIFI SSID, WIFI Password, and Main topic.

A sample text config file is as follows:

[general]
WIFISSID = nunya
WIFIPASS = statesecret
MQTTHOST = 127.0.0.1
MQTTTOPIC = /home/control/relay
